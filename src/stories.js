  "After a long day horsing around in Yosemite, night had fallen and we were on our way back to our cabin. One of my friends needed to pee, but there was an incredibly slow driver on the one-lane road out of the park. Our expected 25 minute ride became 45, and there was a MINIMUM 15 car line. My friend driving did her best to weave and cut the line, but it was futile and we needed to pull over. The cars that we passed were honking, laughing at us as my friend was peeing in the cold, dark forest.", 

  "Singing to EPIC: The Musical while driving through the snows of Tahoe. Then getting pulled over cause we forgot to put the snow chains on…", 

  "Outrunning a thunderstorm through central Texas with my dad during our Florida to California roadtrip. It was a spectacular light show, the likes of which I do not believe I will be able to ever replicate again.", 

  "Totally heterosexual dudes, most with girlfriends, we skipped school and packed a car where there's like 6 dudes in a small car. Driver hits the CD button and the Backstreet Boys album starts to play. He changes it saying it's his girlfriends but one by one we agreed that some songs are catchy. Pretty soon we're just driving around singing to the album.", 

  "In the summer of 2014 my friends and I were driving in the New Mexico desert near To'hajiilee, just outside of Albuquerque, looking for Breaking Bad locations. We found the exact spot where Walt tries to kill himself in the first episode. We bought some clothes, underwear, a fake gun, and we did a mini photoshoot to recreate the scene starring us.",

  "Drove to a completely different state (QLD to NSW in Australia) to see what their maccas tasted like. It was shit..",

  "Decided to push further in a day than we planned to. So we needed to find a place to sleep over asap. Ended up finding this small unknown place out in the middle of nowhere. Sitting there, having a beer, recovering from the 9 hour very tiring drive we had some surprise visitors. A huge heard of elephants just walked right passed us to the small water hole in the middle of the campsite and started drinking water and bathing themselves. More and more elephants would just keep coming and going pretty much through the whole night.", 

  "Me and my girlfriend with another couple packed in my suburban. Something like 6000 miles over 15 days from Michigan to California and back via Texas. Camping and exploring the whole time. I proposed to my girlfriend and we eloped on that trip.", 

  "I drove to Denver while my wife and grandma flew. Picked them up and we explored the mountains, Moab, went to Lake Tahoe, donner lake, and Yosemite. My grandma had a stroke and died two weeks after we got home. I'll cherish those memories forever.", 

  "Standing bare footed in the still warm sand of the Mesquite sand dunes watching the sun set. Then leaving the park driving like a maniac in a sports cabrio top down taking the hills on the 190 fast enough for zero G. Then leaving the paved road a bit and stopping to eat Pizza laid back in the car with only the stars providing light. Didn't see a single soul the whole way.", 

  "After my Mom passed, she left a diary of a trip she and her friends took from Duluth, MN to Yellowstone in late August 1939. I followed it about ten years ago as precisely as I could to date, time, and place following exactly in her footsteps. Badlands NP had just opened, there were still workers on Mt Rushmore, and I had photos of all her stops. There were times I could almost see her as a young woman.", 

  "August 2023, my wife was 68 yrs old and I was 73. Drove the Dempster Highway from near Dawson City in the Yukon to Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories in a Jeep wrangler. 560 miles of gravel road (one way). Crossed the Artic Circle, waded in the Artic Ocean. One last great adventure for us both.", 

  "Did a road trip from Florida to Boston, MA with my wife. We took a small detour and went to Virginia Beach for a day. It rained all day, but we read our books on the balcony. We also still went out to the beach in the rain. That was fun. Additionally, we got some amazing Italian food in North End when we made it to Boston. The trip was filled with good memories of eating homemade snacks and seeing new places, even if it was a shorter road trip.", 

  "At one of the campsites, chef (a dude who didn't skate but wanted to come and brought a kitchen installed on the back of his flat-bed truck) managed to attach a chainsaw motor to a scooter (slightly larger than a Razor). There was no clutch or brake, and it had to be compression started. Shenanigans on the fire roads ensued... I still can't believe nobody broke a bone.", 

  "Wife and I were on a trip in California and one day was special. Started in Bridgeport on the east side of the Sierras which is south of Carson City NV. About 8:00 am we are driving south on Hwy 395, it's mid November and no other cars on the road. I see a CHP car with his lights on weaving around coming my way. I stop and he pulls up beside me and tells me there is a herd of cattle coming and to just sit still and let them pass. A couple minutes later here they come, hundreds of cattle passing on both sides of my truck. That's when we realized we hadn't brought a camera.", 

  "I had been on a lot of short roadtrips/camping trips with my buddies but then i met this girl fresh in town from Philadelphia. It was summer in Phoenix and we drove her '79 Pontiac Grand Prix to San Diego. We checked into a roadside hotel, partied all night, laid in the sun and swam in the ocean all day. Dont remember anything specific but i realized then i had been doing roadtrips all wrong. And Yeah, were on a roadtrip right now.", 

  "We did a road trip that took in several states. I was building a model, and when.we hit SanFrancisco, we were on a street where the kids were cruisin. There was a bight yellow super Bee there. Man that was cool. The baddest Detroit had to offer were all there that night", 

  "We were on a road trip and along the way we passed a campground on a river and we saw kids in a rope swing. Our dad stopped even though he wanted to make it a little farther on our trip that day. We had the best time in that rope swing and met so many new friends.",

  "Summer of 1976, My Father rented cabins for his whole family in Lake George, New York the week of the 4th of July. Best vacation ever!! All my Cousins and my Grandparents we had a great time."
